## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 (Initial Release)

This is the first public release of the Zero-AI-Trace Framework. The framework provides a comprehensive approach to controlling LLM behavior with a focus on:

1. **Accuracy through verification protocols**
2. **Transparency through labeling systems**
3. **Natural writing through humanization techniques**
4. **Undetectability through pattern breaking**

The release includes all core functionality needed to implement the framework with any compatible LLM, along with comprehensive documentation and community contribution guidelines.

#### What's Included

- Core framework prompt (compact version)
- Detailed implementation guide
- Before/after examples
- Multi-LLM testing recommendations
- Community contribution framework
- Professional project structure

#### Getting Started

1. Copy the compact prompt from the README
2. Inject it into your LLM interface
3. Test with uncertain questions to verify labeling
4. Observe improved natural writing style
5. Refer to examples for expected behavior

#### Next Steps

Future releases will focus on:

- Additional LLM testing and optimization
- Extended example library
- Performance metrics and studies
- Community feedback integration
- Advanced techniques development
