## 🎯 What is the Zero-AI-Trace Framework?

The Zero-AI-Trace Framework is a set of strict guidelines that transforms how LLMs (Large Language Models) generate content. It targets three main objectives:

1. **🔍 Transparency**: Force verification and labeling of uncertain content
2. **🚫 Authenticity**: Eliminate typically AI-sounding formulations
3. **💫 Naturalness**: Inject rhythm and human imperfections

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Mandatory verification** of uncertain content with labeling system
- 🎭 **Automatic humanization** of writing style
- 🔒 **Anti-detection techniques** by breaking AI patterns
- 🛠️ **Integrated correction protocols** automatic self-correction
- 📦 **Compact format** optimized for system injection
- 🔧 **Universal compatibility** with all major LLMs
- 🧪 **Automated testing** and continuous validation
- 🚀 **Professional CLI interface** with 6 commands
- 📚 **Comprehensive documentation** and detailed guides

## 🎬 Quick Example

**❌ Without the framework:**

```text
I highly recommend using this approach as it significantly improves performance in all possible contexts.
```

**✅ With the framework:**

```text
[Inference] This approach seems to work well from what I observe, but it totally depends on your specific context.
```
