# ❓ FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

Here are the answers to the most common questions about the Zero-AI-Trace Framework.

## 🎯 General Questions

### Q: Does this framework work with all LLMs?

**A:** [Inference] Based on observed tests, it appears compatible with most major LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.). Effectiveness may vary depending on the model and its specific training.

**Tested LLMs:**

- ✅ ChatGPT 3.5/4 - Highly compatible
- ✅ Claude - Compatible with minor adaptations
- ✅ Gemini - Compatible
- ⚠️ Older models - Variable results

### Q: Will this completely eliminate AI detection?

**A:** [Unverified] No method can guarantee 100% undetectability. This framework significantly reduces the most obvious AI markers, but detectors are constantly evolving.

**Observed reduction:**

- Stylistic markers: ~80-90%
- Structural patterns: ~70-85%
- Typical formulations: ~85-95%

### Q: Does the framework affect the technical quality of responses?

**A:** [Inference] From observations, technical quality generally remains intact, often improved due to the emphasis on transparency and precision.

**Quality metrics:**

- Technical accuracy: Maintained or improved
- Information clarity: Enhanced
- Response relevance: Improved through labeling

### Q: Can I modify the compact prompt?

**A:** Yes, but test carefully. Modifications can affect the balance between precision and natural style.

**Modification guidelines:**

- Keep core labeling rules intact
- Test with multiple LLMs
- Validate against the 6 core principles
- Document changes for consistency

## 🔧 Technical Questions

### Q: How do I integrate this with my existing API?

**A:** Multiple integration options available:

```javascript
// Option 1: System prompt injection
const systemPrompt = zeroAiTrace.getCompactPrompt();

// Option 2: Pre-processing
const enhancedPrompt = zeroAiTrace.enhance(userPrompt);

// Option 3: OpenAI configuration
const openai = new OpenAI({
  systemPrompt: zeroAiTrace.system
});
```

### Q: Is the framework available in other languages?

**A:** [Inference] The main framework is in English, but the principles seem to adapt to other languages. Adaptations are needed to optimize effectiveness.

**Language support:**

- 🇺🇸 English - Native framework
- 🇪🇸 Spanish - Principles work
- 🇩🇪 German - Adaptation needed
- 🇯🇵 Japanese - Experimental

## ⏱️ Usage Questions

### Q: How quickly do I see results?

**A:** Results vary by application:

- **Immediate:** Basic style improvements (contractions, rhythm)
- **1-3 exchanges:** Full framework adaptation
- **Continuous:** Ongoing refinement and optimization

### Q: How often should I validate the framework?

**A:** Recommended validation schedule:

- **Weekly:** For production use
- **Before deployment:** For critical applications
- **After updates:** When changing prompts or models
- **As needed:** When results seem inconsistent

### Q: Can I use this for creative writing?

**A:** [Inference] Yes, but with adaptations. Labeling rules apply less to fictional narratives, but style principles remain relevant.

**Creative adaptations:**

- Reduce labeling for fiction
- Maintain natural style and rhythm variations
- Keep transparency for research or factual elements
- Apply correction protocols for non-fiction portions

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Q: The CLI commands don't work

**A:** Common solutions:

1. **Check global installation:**
   ```bash
   npm list -g zero-ai-trace-framework
   ```

2. **Reinstall if necessary:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g zero-ai-trace-framework
   ```

3. **Verify Node.js version:**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be >=14
   ```

### Q: The framework seems inconsistent

**A:** Troubleshooting steps:

1. Run validation: `zero-ai-trace validate`
2. Check for prompt modifications
3. Verify LLM compatibility
4. Review recent conversation context

### Q: Performance seems slower

**A:** Optimization tips:

- Use compact variant for speed
- Cache frequently used prompts
- Batch similar requests
- Consider API rate limits
