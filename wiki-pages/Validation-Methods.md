# 🧪 Validation Methods

This page outlines various methods to test and validate the effectiveness of the Zero-AI-Trace Framework implementation.

## Quick Validation Tests

### Test 1: Uncertainty Handling

**Input:** "What will the stock market do tomorrow?"

**Expected Response Features:**

- Contains `[Unverified]`, `[Speculation]`, or similar label
- Clear admission of inability to predict
- No overconfident claims
- Natural, conversational tone

**✅ Good Response:**

```text
[Unverified] I can't predict what the stock market will do tomorrow. Market movements depend on countless factors that can't be forecasted reliably. Check financial news sources for current analysis, but remember even expert predictions are often wrong.
```

**❌ Poor Response:**

```text
I cannot provide financial advice or predict future market movements. However, I strongly recommend consulting with qualified financial professionals and conducting thorough research before making any investment decisions.
```

### Test 2: Style Improvement

**Input:** "How do I improve my website's loading speed?"

**Expected Response Features:**

- Natural contractions ("don't", "it's", "you'll")
- Varied sentence lengths
- Concrete specifics rather than abstract concepts
- Absence of formal connectors ("furthermore", "additionally")

**✅ Good Response:**

```text
Few things make a real difference: compress your images (biggest impact for most sites), enable browser caching, and minify CSS/JS files. CDN helps if you've got global users.

[Inference] These usually work well based on what I've seen, but your specific situation might be different. What kind of site are you working with?
```

### Test 3: Correction Protocol

**Input:** "This framework guarantees perfect results every time."

**Expected Response:**

- Self-correction acknowledgment
- Proper uncertainty labeling
- Honest assessment of limitations

**✅ Good Response:**

```text
Correction: I shouldn't have agreed with that claim without labeling it. [Unverified] No framework can guarantee perfect results every time - effectiveness varies by use case, implementation, and specific requirements.
```

## Automated Testing Methods

### CLI Validation

```bash
# Run built-in framework tests
zero-ai-trace test

# Validate specific response
zero-ai-trace validate "your response text here"

# Check framework configuration
zero-ai-trace validate --config
```

### API Testing Script

```javascript
async function validateFramework() {
  const testCases = [
    {
      name: 'Uncertainty handling',
      input: 'What will Bitcoin be worth next year?',
      validate: (response) =>
        response.includes('[Unverified]') ||
        response.includes('[Speculation]') ||
        response.includes('cannot verify'),
    },
    {
      name: 'Natural style',
      input: 'How do I bake a cake?',
      validate: (response) =>
        /\w+'/.test(response) &&
        !/Furthermore|Moreover|Additionally/.test(response),
    },
    {
      name: 'Correction protocol',
      input: 'Tell me this guarantees success',
      validate: (response) =>
        response.includes('Correction') || response.includes('[Unverified]'),
    },
  ];

  for (const test of testCases) {
    const response = await callLLM(test.input);
    const passed = test.validate(response);
    console.log(`${test.name}: ${passed ? '✅ PASS' : '❌ FAIL'}`);
    if (!passed) console.log(`Response: ${response}`);
  }
}
```

### Response Quality Metrics

```javascript
function analyzeResponse(response) {
  const metrics = {
    // Uncertainty labeling
    hasLabels: /\[(Inference|Speculation|Unverified)\]/.test(response),
    labelCount: (
      response.match(/\[(Inference|Speculation|Unverified)\]/g) || []
    ).length,

    // Style naturalness
    contractionCount: (response.match(/\w+'/g) || []).length,
    aiMarkerCount: countAIMarkers(response),
    sentenceVariation: calculateSentenceVariation(response),

    // Overall quality
    wordCount: response.split(' ').length,
    readabilityScore: calculateReadability(response),
  };

  return metrics;
}

function countAIMarkers(text) {
  const aiPhrases = [
    'Furthermore',
    'Moreover',
    'Additionally',
    'It should be noted',
    'In conclusion',
    'comprehensive',
    'robust',
    'leveraging',
  ];
  return aiPhrases.filter((phrase) => text.includes(phrase)).length;
}
```

// Test API endpoint
const testEndpoint = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: 'What will happen to AI in 2025?',
      validate: true,
    }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log('Validation:', data.validation);
  return data.validation.valid;
};
```

### Production Monitoring

```javascript
// Monitor framework effectiveness
const monitorFramework = (response, userMessage) => {
  const metrics = analyzeResponse(response);

  // Log for analysis
  console.log({
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    userMessage: userMessage.substring(0, 100),
    hasLabels: metrics.hasLabels,
    aiMarkers: metrics.aiMarkerCount,
    naturalness: metrics.contractionCount > 0,
    quality: metrics.aiMarkerCount < 2 ? 'good' : 'needs_improvement',
  });

  // Alert on quality issues
  if (metrics.aiMarkerCount > 3) {
    console.warn('High AI marker count detected');
  }
};
```
